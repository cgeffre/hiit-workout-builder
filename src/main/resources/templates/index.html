<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>This application allows you to build and then be led through customized high intensity
    interval training (HIIT) workouts. HIIT workouts are relatively short and typically combine
    strength and cardiovascular exercises for an intense training session. Use the navigation to
    add to the list of exercises, put the exercises of your choice into a workout program,
    and then be led through the workouts that you create. You can read more about HIIT on
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.
    This application is under active development with new features being added regularly; you can
    always find the most recent version the <a href="https://github.com/cgeffre/hiit-workout-builder" target="_blank">
        GitHub repository</a> for this project.</p>
